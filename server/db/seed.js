But, as they say, 'weird is relative'. The mansion is decorated with various bricabrac, all of which seem to hail from different tastes. This ranges from suits of armor to life-sized preserved animal remains. Doors tend to open and close on their own, and there appear to be numerous unseen passageways through which the disembodied hand, Thing, may travel.",

One hundred thousand trees, twenty thousand tons of marble are the ingredients of Xanadu's mountain. Contents of Xanadu's palace: paintings, pictures, statues, the very stones of many another palace â€” a collection of everything so big it can never be cataloged or appraised; enough for ten museums; the loot of the world. Xanadu's livestock: the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, the beast of the field and jungle. Two of each; the biggest private zoo since Noah. Like the Pharaohs, Xanadu's landlord leaves many stones to mark his grave. Since the Pyramids, Xanadu is the costliest monument a man has built to himself.",
